On this page you'll find a few destinations that I wish to share and hope that it does well in displaying my dedication and passion to the hobbies I have and with to make a career out of them. Some have received less attention than I would like to admit. 

A _**[community ][0]**_designed for the positive prospects of playing video games, table top games, and pursuing hobbies. We, a friend and myself, have designed a website to be a one-stop destination for community members to take part in and find information about the community. We have a temporary location for one of our divisions, _**[Black Desert Online guild][1]**_. 

Live video streams via _**[Twitch][2]**_ of video game play through's where you are able to interact with a live audience, and corresponding _**[YouTube][3]**_. These videos range from comic to series. Aside from my personal locations, there are plans for a community based Twitch and YouTube that is apart of the community mentioned previously.
